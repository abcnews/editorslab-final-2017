Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigns after pressure from key investors

Uber chief executive and co-founder Travis Kalanick has resigned from the troubled ride-booking service under pressure from investors.

On June 13, Mr Kalanick went on indefinite leave amid criticism of his management style and following the death of his mother in a boating accident.

The resignation came after a series of costly missteps by Mr Kalanick and the fast-growing company that he helped found eight years ago.

Uber on Monday embarked on a 180-day program to change its image by allowing riders to give drivers tips through the Uber app, something the company had resisted under Mr Kalanick.

The San Francisco-based company is trying to reverse damage done to its reputation by revelations of sexual harassment in its offices, allegations of trade secrets theft and an investigation into efforts to mislead government regulators.

The Uber board said in a statement Mr Kalanick had "always put Uber first" and that his resignation would give the company "room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history".

Board member Bill Gurley — who is also a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, one of the five key investors named by the New York Times as having demanded Mr Kalanick's resignation — appeared to praise the embattled executive's achievements in a Twitter post, saying he had made a "lasting impact" on the world.

Mr Kalanick will remain on the Uber Technologies Inc board.

Resignation comes after months of scandal
-----------------------------------------

While building the world's biggest ride-booking service, Uber developed a reputation for ruthless tactics that have occasionally outraged government regulators, drivers, riders and its employees.

Before going on leave, in early June, Mr Kalanick acknowledged he needed "to become a better leader".

"The ultimate responsibility, for where we've gotten and how we've gotten here rests on my shoulders," he said.

The trouble began in January when Uber was accused of capitalising on a on a protest by New York taxi drivers against President Donald Trump's immigration ban. Uber drivers picked up passengers from Kennedy Airport while cab drivers refused to do so. Since then scandals have engulfed the company.

The company's hard-charging style has led to legal trouble. The US Justice Department is investigating Uber's past usage of phony software designed to thwart regulators.
