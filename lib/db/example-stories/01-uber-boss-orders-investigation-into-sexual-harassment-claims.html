<h1>Uber boss orders investigation into claims of sexual harassment within company</h1>
<p>Ride-booking company Uber has announced an urgent investigation into claims of sexual harassment and discrimination at the company, as well as threats from management against those who complain.</p>
<div data-card="uber-sexual-harassment-allegations">
  <p data-aware>The investigation has been prompted by a 3,000-word blog post that has since gone viral, former employee Susan Fowler detailed what she described as "a very, very strange year at Uber".</p>

<h2>Sexual harassment in tech nothing new: advocate</h2>
<p>Jenine Beekhuyzen, chief executive of the Tech Girls movement in Australia, said Ms Fowler's account of her time at Uber was not news.</p>
<p>"Sadly it's not as isolated as they'd like to think it is, and we don't hear about it a lot because essentially women just don't talk about it," Dr Beekhuyzen said.</p>

    <p>"Because if we talk about it then we have to deal with it, and if we do that every day and call it out then we'd never get through the day."</p>

<p>Dr Beekhuyzen, whose organisation promotes a more diverse IT workplace, said over the years she had experienced plenty of sexism working in the tech industry.</p>
<p>"The immediate assumption that you don't have skills because you're a woman, the assumption that you're in the room to take notes and bring coffee and those kinds of things," she said.</p>
<p>Uber is one of the few major tech companies that has yet to publish statistics on its workplace diversity.</p>
<p>In her blog post, Ms Fowler claimed her section of Uber was made up of roughly 25 per women when she started, but dropped to less than 6 per cent by the time she left.</p>
<p>Dr Beekhuyzen said simply getting women to work in the industry at all was tough.</p>
<p>"We're not getting women coming into the tech industry, but once they do come in and sort of fight their way through, then they're faced with these kinds of challenges," she said.</p>
<p>According to Dr Beekhyuzan, women working in the industry have as much of a responsibility to bring about change as men.</p>
<p>"All staff need to have training in unconscious bias, and this is women as well â€” women also engage in unconscious bias, we are just as much to blame," she said.</p>
<p>"These biases are ingrained and you don't realise the impact of them."</p>
