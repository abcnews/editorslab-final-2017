<h1>Uber boss Travis Kalanick says he must 'grow up' after argument with driver caught on dash cam</h1>
<p>Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick says it is time for him to "grow up" and get help after a video surfaced of him having an argument with an Uber driver over pay rates.</p>
<p>The heated exchange was captured on a dash cam and shows Mr Kalanick, co-founder of the company, arguing with the driver who tells him pay rates have been cut and he has lost money.</p>
<p>The trip appeared to run smoothly until two fellow passengers left the car at the end of the ride.</p>
<p>After Mr Kalanick thanked the driver and shook his hand, the Uber employee raised the subject of pay rate cuts to the Uber Black service — one of their luxury ride options.</p>
<p>"I lost $97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you," he said to Mr Kalanick as they discussed the price of cars.</p>
<p>"You keep changing every day!</p>
<p>"You dropped the prices [on Uber Black]." — a claim Mr Kalanick called "bulls***".</p>
<p>Mr Kalanick responded angrily saying, "Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit".</p>
<p>"They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck," he said.</p>
<p>These final words have landed Mr Kalanick in hot water and prompted him to issue a "profound" apology to Uber employees.</p>
<p>In his statement, Mr Kalanick said he was ashamed for treating the driver disrespectfully, apologising to the driver and others.</p>
<p>"It's clear this video is a reflection of me, and the criticism we've received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up," the apology stated.</p>
<p>"This is the first time I've been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it."</p>
<p>The video is the latest in a series of challenges and embarrassments for the ride service.</p>
<p>Last week, Alphabet's self-driving vehicle unit Waymo sued Uber for allegedly stealing designs related to autonomous vehicles, a claim that Uber has denied.</p>
<p>Uber also is investigating allegations of sexual harassment in its own organisation.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a female former engineer at Uber said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers at the company had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances, and even threatened her with a poor performance review.</p>
