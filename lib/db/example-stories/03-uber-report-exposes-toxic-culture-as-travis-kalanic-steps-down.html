<h1>Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to take leave as report exposes toxic culture inside company</h1>
<p>Uber CEO <a data-annotation="travis-kalanick">Travis Kalanick</a> has announced he will take a leave of absence for an unspecified period and let his leadership team run the troubled ride-booking company while he is gone.</p>
<p>Mr Kalanick told employees of his decision in a memo, saying he needs time off to grieve for his mother, who died in a May boating accident.</p>
<p>He also says he's responsible for the company's current situation.</p>
<p>Uber has been in turmoil as allegations of sexual harassment and questions over Mr Kalanick's treatment of his staff emerged in recent months.</p>
<p>Mr Kalanick noted in his statement he "needs to become a better leader".</p>
<p>"The ultimate responsibility, for where we've gotten and how we've gotten here rests on my shoulders," the statement read.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as former US Attorney Eric Holder released a list of recommendations to improve Uber's toxic workplace culture, which condoned sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation against those who reported problems.</p>
<p>Mr Holder recommended that Mr Kalanick be relieved of some leadership responsibilities, shifting them to a chief operating officer and other senior managers. The COO, yet to be hired, would be a partner with Mr Kalanick.</p>
<p>"Uber should use performance reviews to hold senior managers accountable by setting metrics for improving diversity and responsiveness to employee complaints," the report says.</p>
