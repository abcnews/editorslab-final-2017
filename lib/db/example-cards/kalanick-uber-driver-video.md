Mr Kalanick was caught on tape having an argument with an Uber driver over pay rates.

In the video, Mr Kalanick can be heard saying: "Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit."

"They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck," he said.

The argument was captured on dash cam and prompted the then-chief executive to issue a "profound" apology to employees.
