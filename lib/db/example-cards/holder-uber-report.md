<p>Former US Attorney Eric Hoolder's firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP, and a second firm, Perkins Coie, conducted separate examinations of Uber's workplace culture after a former engineer levelled charges of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Mr Holder's investigators conducted more than 200 interviews with current and former employees, including people who had knowledge of Ms Fowler's allegations, according to the law firm's recommendations .</p>
<p>Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer, said implementing the recommendations "will improve our culture, promote fairness and accountability, and establish processes and systems to ensure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated".</p>
<p>The report makes it clear Uber was not doing enough to protect workers from sexual harassment and retaliation, noting that company policies need to state directly that such conduct is prohibited.</p>
<p>In addition, Uber must require that managers immediately report discrimination, harassment or retaliation, and ensure that codes of conduct apply to offsite events and conferences.</p>
<p>Uber's board said it would review Mr Kalanick's responsibilities and reassign some to others. The board will continue its search for a chief operating officer with a background in diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>The board also recommended adding independent directors and replacing its chairman, co-founder Garrett Camp, with an independent chairman.</p>
<p>The board currently has eight voting members, three from within the company. The board also called for appointment of a senior executive to oversee implementation of Holder's recommendations.</p>
<p>Mr Holder recommends that Uber make sure its workforce becomes more diverse from the top down.</p>
<p>Uber's diversity figures are similar to the rest of Silicon Valley, with low numbers for women and underrepresented minorities. In the US, less than a third of the company's workers are female.</p>
<p>In addition, the report says that diversity and inclusiveness should be a key value for Uber included in management training.</p>
<p>The word diversity appears 42 times in the 13-page recommendations document.</p>
<p>While Uber released Mr Holder's recommendations, his full report was kept private to protect the privacy of those filing complaints. The company's board unanimously adopted all of the recommendations on Sunday.</p>
