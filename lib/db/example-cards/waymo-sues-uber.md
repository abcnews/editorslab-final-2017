Waymo, the Alphabet owned company building self-driving cars, has begun legal proceedings against Uber and its subsidiary, Otto, which it alleges the company's self-driving car technology was stolen in what it calls a "calculated theft."

The law suit alleges that Anthony Levandowski, a former employee of Waymo, took the company's trade secrets before leaving to start his own autonomous vehicle company, Otto. Otto was subsequently acquired by Uber.

The lawsuit centres around the specifications for Waymo's LiDAR sensors, which are a core technology in autonomous vehicles which allow the system to 'see' objects like pedestrians and other vehicles.

Waymo claims that before leaving the company, Mr Levandowski downloaded a large amount of data from the company's internal design server before trying to cover his tracks by wiping his work computer. There are also claims that he met with Uber executives just one day before leaving Waymo and forming his new company Otto.

While Waymo claims to have had grave concerns about Uber's acquisition of Otto from the start, its suspicions were confirmed in an apparent mishap involving a supplier who sent circuit board designs to Waymo which appears to have been intended for Otto. The designs included in the email bore a striking resemblan ce to Waymo's own secret designs.
