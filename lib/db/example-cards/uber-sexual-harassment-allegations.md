A female former engineer at Uber said in a widely read blog post that managers and human resources officers at the company had not punished her manager after she reported his unwanted sexual advances, and even threatened her with a poor performance review.

In a 3,000-word blog post that has since gone viral, former employee Susan Fowler detailed what she described as "a very, very strange year at Uber".

Ms Fowler alleged that on her first day as a programmer and engineer at Uber, her manager sexually propositioned her over the company's internal chat system.

She said when she complained to human resources, she was dismissed.

"Upper management told me that he 'was a high performer' â€¦ and they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part," she wrote.

Ms Fowler said her pathway to promotion was blocked after the incident, and she left the company after further complaints she made about harassment and sexism fell on deaf ears.
