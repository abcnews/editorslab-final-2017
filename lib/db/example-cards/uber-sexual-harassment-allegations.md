In a 3,000-word blog post that has since gone viral, former employee Susan Fowler detailed what she described as "a very, very strange year at Uber".

Ms Fowler alleged that on her first day as a programmer and engineer at Uber, her manager sexually propositioned her over the company's internal chat system.

She said when she complained to human resources, she was dismissed.

"Upper management told me that he 'was a high performer' â€¦ and they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part," she wrote.

Ms Fowler said her pathway to promotion was blocked after the incident, and she left the company after further complaints she made about harassment and sexism fell on deaf ears.

After the essay was posted online earlier this week, it has been shared tens of thousands of times.

Uber's chief executive Travis Kalanick has since taken to Twitter to announce a full investigation.

"What's described here is abhorrent & against everything we believe in. Anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired [sic]," he tweeted.

"I've instructed our chief human resources officer Liane to conduct an urgent investigation. There can be absolutely no place for this kind of behaviour at Uber."
